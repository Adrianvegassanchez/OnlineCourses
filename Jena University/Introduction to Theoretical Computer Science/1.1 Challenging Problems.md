## What do we do about them

- Complexity theory
  - How much time and memory is needed
- Computability
  - Can a computer solve the problem at all
    - Given all time and memory
    

## Course Objectives

- Will be able to recognize challenging problems
- Understand what makes them challenging
- Navigate around computational complexity


## Computability of Complexity Theory

**Is the following question about computability or complexity theory**

- (a) How fast can a computer find a way between two points on a map
- (b) Can a program decide if another program is malware
- (c) How much memory is needed to sort a given database

**Answers** : (a) is complexity, (b) is computability, (c) is complexity

## Alice, Bob and Carol

Alice works in tele-communications, Bob works in biotech, and Carol works in finance.

### Alice

- The company she works for owns a tele communication centers around the world
- These centers are connected through cables around the world
- Not every center is connected to each other but they are collectively connected 
- The company has a monitoring device that checks the integrity of all the connections
- To expand monitoring, you need to add more devices and the devices are expensive 
- Goal is to install as few devices as we can to solve the problem

**Find the number of devices needed to monitor the whole network**

**Answer** : 4

**Where to install monitoring devices so that minimum number of them are used?**

*Answer:* top and bottom 


#### Alice's Algorithm

**Pseudocode**


    1. minimum_devices = number of communication centers
    2. for each assignment of (0,1) to the communication centers:
    3.    # valid means all cables are monitored
    4.    if assignment is_valid:
    5.        number_of_devices = number of '1's in assignment
    6.        minimum_devices = min(minimum_devoces, number_of_devices)
    

**For a network with 5 communication centers, how ofter are lines 4-6 executed?**

*Answer:* 32 (2^5). 

It's 32 because we have to construct 2 possibilities for each case (0 or 1). So for 20 communication centers, the lines will have to execute 1048576 times.
