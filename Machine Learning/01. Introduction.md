## Introduction

Machine learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed

**Examples of Machine Learning**

- Database Mining : Making sense of large datasets from growth of automation
 	+ Web Click Data
	+ Computational Biology (gene sequencing)
- Applications that cant be programmed by hand
	+ Handwriting recognition / OCR
	+ Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Self-customizing programs
	+ Product recommendations

## What is Machine Learning 

A computer program is said to **learn** from experience **E** with respect to some task **T** and some performance measure **P**, improves with experience **E**

**Q**: *Suppose your email program watches which emails you do or do not mark as spam, and based on that learns how to better filter spam, What is the task* **T** *in this setting?*

- **T** : Classifying emails as spam or not spam
	* **E** : Watching you label emails as spam or not spam
	* **P** : The ratio of emails correctly classified as spam/not spam

## Types of Learning Algorithms

- Supervised Learning
	+ You teach the computer how to do something
- Unsupervised Learning
	+ The computer tries to learn all by itself
- Reinforcement Learning
- Recommender Systems


### Supervised Learning

The terms refers to the fact where the given dataset is assumed to be "correct"  and this technique is mainly used to solve regression problems (predicts continous value attribute).

- A classification problem is a problem where a discrete valued output is expected from the algorithm given a dataset.


### Unsupervised Learning

Used to find a structure or a pattern in a given dataset. These algorithms are used to mostly help compute social network analysis and things like astronomical data analysis.

**Cocktail Party Problem**

At a party where 2 people are talking at the same time where 2 microphones are placed in the same room at different distances from each other. The microphones record an overlapping conversation of both the speakers. The cocktail party algorithm determines the overlap and separates out the two distinct voices.

The Algorithm:

```
[W, s, v] = svd((repmat(sum(x.*x, 1), size(x, 1), 1).*x)*x');
```

Where:

-  `svd()` : Singular Value Decomposition function
