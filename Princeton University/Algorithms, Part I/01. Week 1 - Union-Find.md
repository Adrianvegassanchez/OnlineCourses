## Why Study Algorithms

- Intellectual stimulation
- Solve problems
- Fun and profit
- etc

## Prerequisites

- Know some programming
- Knowledge of Java
- High school math


## Dynamic Connectivity

### Steps to solve

- Model the problem
- Find and algo to solve it
- Fast enough? Fits in mem?
- If not, figure out why
- Find a way to address the problem
- Iterate until satisfied

### Problem

Given a set of N objects

- Union command: connect to objects
- Find/connected query: is there a path connecting two objects

### Applications

- Pixels
- Networking
- Social network
- etc

### Modelling the relation

We assume 'is connected to' is an equivalence relation

- Reflexive: *p* is connected to *p*
- Symmetric: if *p* is connected to *q*, then *q* is connected to *p*
- Transistive: if *p* is connected to *q* and *q* is connected to *r*, then *p* is connected to *r*

### Goal

Design efficient data structure for union-find

- Number of objects N can be huge
- Number of operations M can be huge
- Find queries and union commands may be intermixed

### Dynamic-connectivity client

- Read in number of objects N from stdin
- Repeat
  - read in pair of integers from stdin
  - if they are not yet connected, connect them and print out pair

{
    int N = StdIn.readInt();
    UF uf = new UF(N);
    while(!StdIn.isEmpty())
    {
        int p = StdIn.readInt();
        int q = StdIn.readInt();
        if(!uf.connected(p, q))
        {
            uf.union(p, q);
            StdOut.println(p + ' ' + q);
        }
    }
}
```


### Question

**How many connected components result after perfoming the following sequence:**
```
1-2  3-4  5-6  7-8  7-9  2-8  0-5  1-9
```
**Answer:** 3
