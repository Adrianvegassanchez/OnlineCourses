## Counter

### Rules for making new words

**Example**

 A new word can be made by adding a counter to the word

```
Word => counter - word
```

#### So

- Intelligence
- Counter-intelligence
- Counter-counter-intelligene

## Counter Quiz

**If the only rule we have for making words is adding `counter` in front of it, how many words can you make out of it?**

- (a) None
- (b) 1
- (c) 2
- (d) Infinitely many

**Answer:** (a)


## Expanding Our Grammar

**How many different words can we make starting from Word using only these 2 rules**

- Word => counter->Word
- Word => hippopotomonstrosequipedaliophobia

- (a) None
- (b) 1
- (c) 2
- (d) Infinitely many

**Answer:** (d)

## Recursive Definitions

### Two parts:

1. Base case - A starting point
    - Not defined in terms of itself
    - Smallest input - already know the answer

2. Recursive case
    - Defined in terms of "smaller" versions of itself 

### Ancestors

**Which of these is the best definition of ancestors?**

- (a) 
    - Ancestor -> Parent of Ancestor

- (b)
    - Ancestor -> Parent
    - Ancestor -> Parent of Ancestor

- (c)
    - Ancestor -> Parent
    - Ancestor -> Parent of Parent
    - Ancestor -> Parent of Parent of Ancestor

**Answer:** (b)

## Recursive Procedures

### Defining Procedures Recursively

```
factorial(n) = n * (n-a) * (n-2) * ... * 1
```

**Base Case**

```
factorial(0) = 1 # base case
```

**Mathematically**
```
factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)
n > 0 # recursive case
```

**Define a procedure `factorial` that takes a natural number as its input and outputs the number of ways to arrange the input number of items**

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n < 2:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)

print factorial(0) #>>> 1
print factorial(5) #>>> 120
print factorial(10) #>>> 3628800
```

## Palindromes

**Define a procedure `is_palindrome` that takes as input a string, and output a boolean indicating if input string is palindrome**

- Base case `"" -> True`
- Recursive case
    - If the first and last characters dont match -> False
    - If they do match, is middle a palindrome?

```python
 def is_palindrome(s):
    if s == "" or len(s) == 1:
        return True
    if s[0] != s[-1]:
        return False
    else:
        s = s[1:-1]
        is_palindrome(s)
        return True
 ``` 

### Recursive Vs Iterative

```python
def iter_palindrome(s):
    for i in range(0, len(s)/2):
        if s[i] != s[-i+1]:
            return False
    return True
```

## Bunnies

### Fibonacci Numbers

- Base Case
    - fib(0) = 0
    - fib(1) = 1

```
fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

**Define a procedure, fibonacci, that takes a natural number as its input, and returns the value of that fibonacci number.**

```python
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

## Counting Calls

**With the recursive definitions, how many times will we need to evaluate `fib(30)`**

**Answer:** 13

## Faster Fibonacci

**Define a faster `fibonacci` procedure that will enable us to computer `fibonacci(36)`**

```
while
    | keep track of fibonacci(n-1)
    | and fibonacci (n-2)
```

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    cache = {0:0, 1:1}
    total = 0
    back  = 2
    i = n
    
    while n > 1:
        cache[back] = cache[back-1] + cache[back-2]
        back += 1
        n -= 1
    
    return cache[i]
```

**Their Solution**

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    current = 0
    after = 1
    for i in range(0, n):
        current, after = after, current + after
    return current
```
